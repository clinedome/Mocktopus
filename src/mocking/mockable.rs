/// Trait for setting up mocks

    /// The passed closure is called whenever the mocked function is called. Depending on variant of returned
    /// [MockResult](enum.MockResult.html) the mocked function continues to run or returns immediately.
    /// In case of continuation the function arguments can be modified or replaced.
    ///
    /// The mock closure is saved in a
    /// [thread local static storage](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.thread_local.html),
    /// so it has effect only in thread, where it was set.
    /// Each Rust test is executed in separate thread, so mocks do not leak between them.
    /// # Safety
    /// It is up to the user to make sure, that the closure is valid long enough to serve all calls to mocked function.
    /// If the mock closure uses any non-static values or references, it will silently become invalid at some point of
    /// host thread lifetime.
